In our work, we propose to use a pricing signal modeled after the locational marginal price in the transmission system to locally provide price data to the users. The formulation and implementation of the distributional locational marginal price (DLMP) are achieved to develop a fair pricing model. The work is further practically implemented to a grid with Electric Vehicles in addition to the conventional load
