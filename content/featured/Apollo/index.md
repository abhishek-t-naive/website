Automatic speculative POLyhedral Loop Optimizer is a compiler framework for automatic, dynamic and speculative parallelization and optimization of programs loop nests. It allows user to mark in a C/C++ source code nested loops of any kind to be handled by the compiler to take advantage of the underlying multi-core processor architecture.
