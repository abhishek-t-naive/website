- Worked under the guidance of Dr. S.K Nandy on building a Software-Defined, Reconfigurable Tensor-Core for accelerating Neural Network Applications.
- Was responsible for design and verification of some of the key-modules like Address Generation Units, Functional Units and Scratchpad Memory Management in Tensor Core and it's earlier versions.
- Formal intense research environment helped me understand the ingenuity involved in designing next-gen processors with a special focus on catering to the need of compute-intensive applications.
